# SamvidhaanAI_A_Legal_Companion
##Abstract:
SamvidhaanAI is a legal chatbot designed to improve accessibility to the Indian Constitution using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline powered by Google's Gemini AI. The system semantically embeds constitutional content using Googleâ€™s embedding model and retrieves relevant sections through a vector database (ChromaDB). On top of this, Gemini AI interprets and generates accurate, structured legal responses. This project combines Python, LangChain, and Streamlit to offer an intelligent interface that transforms how users interact with complex legal documents. Our aim is to bridge the legal knowledge gap through an AI-driven, technically sound, and context-aware conversational assistant.
